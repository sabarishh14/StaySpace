### StaySpace - Accomodation Recommendation System

## Abstract
Our project focuses on optimizing accommodation selection for individuals with a limited budget. By utilizing the knapsack problem and dynamic programming techniques, we consider factors such as rent, distance, and amenities to identify the best possible accommodations. The solution maximizes the overall score while staying within the specified budget. Through this project, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in providing personalized and cost-effective accommodation recommendations.

## Introduction
Finding the right place to stay within a budget can be a daunting task. People often struggle to balance their preferences for factors like rent, location, and amenities. Our project aims to simplify this process by providing a solution that helps individuals find the best accommodations that meet their needs and budget.

We have developed an innovative approach using advanced algorithms to solve this problem. Our solution takes into account factors like rent, distance from desired locations, and available amenities. By assigning scores to each accommodation option based on these factors, we create a system that quantifies the desirability of each choice. Using this scoring system, our algorithm identifies the best combination of accommodations that fit within the given budget. It maximizes the overall score, ensuring individuals get the most value for their money. This approach enables people to make informed decisions and select accommodations that match their preferences while staying within their financial limits.

Overall, our solution streamlines the process of finding suitable accommodations by leveraging technology and data analysis. It empowers individuals to make well-informed choices, optimizing their housing options based on their unique requirements. This not only saves time and effort but also enhances the overall experience of finding a comfortable and affordable place to stay.

## Algorithm
We utilized the Knapsack problem as an Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms (ADSA) algorithm to optimize accommodation selection. By employing dynamic programming techniques, we effectively consider multiple factors including rent, distance, and amenities to provide personalized recommendations within the specified budget.

## Conclusion
Our project presents a practical solution for individuals seeking cost-effective accommodations tailored to their preferences. By combining advanced algorithms with web technologies, we offer a user-friendly interface that simplifies the process of finding suitable housing options. We believe our approach enhances the overall experience of accommodation selection, ultimately empowering users to make informed decisions within their budget constraints.
